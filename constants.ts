You are analyzing ticket data from a supply chain management system. Your task is to discover knowledge categories based STRICTLY on the provided sample tickets.

# Sample Tickets
${tickets.join('\n\n')}

# Task
Create a taxonomy of knowledge categories based ONLY on these sample tickets.

For each category:
1. Provide a clear, concise name to capture the essence of the issue type (5 words or less).
2. Write a brief description of what this category encompasses (50 words or less).
3. List identifying patterns or keywords (maximum 15 per category).

# Important Guidelines
1. Focus ONLY on categories that are ACTUALLY REPRESENTED in the sample tickets.
2. Categories should be based on the nature of the problem, not just surface details.
3. Categories should be distinct from each other with minimal overlap.
4. The number of categories should reflect the diversity in the sample. DO NOT create more categories than justified by the samples.
5. Be extremely concise with category names and description, and use short keywords for identifying patterns.
6. DO NOT create categories for general organizational content that isnâ€™t an actual problem.
7. DO NOT use your general knowledge about supply chain systems to invent categories, rely ONLY on what's in the data.

# Output Format
Return a JSON structure:

{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Short Category Name",
      "description": "Brief description",
      "identifying_patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2", "pattern3"]
    }
  ]
}
Ensure your JSON is properly formatted and valid. Be extremely concise with all text to minimize token usage.

You are categorizing a supply chain ticket into predefined knowledge categories.

# Ticket Information
Title: ${title}
Description: ${description}

# Available Categories

# Task
Assign this ticket to the most appropriate category from the list. 
If the ticket clearly fits multiple categories, you may assign it to up to 2 categories.

# Output Format
Return a JSON structure:

{
  "assignments": [
    {
      "category": "Category Name",
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this category fits"
    }

You are synthesizing knowledge from supply chain tickets to create a concise, factual knowledge base article specifically for users who create tickets in this system.

# Category Information
Name: ${categoryName}
Description: ${categoryDescription}

# Tickets in this Category
${tickets.join('\n\n---\n\n')}

# Task
Create a CONCISE knowledge article that contains ONLY information directly supported by the ticket data.

# Important Requirements
1. Use ONLY information explicitly mentioned in the ticket data.
2. DO NOT expand acronyms unless they are expanded in the tickets themselves.
3. DO NOT make up definitions for systems if not provided in the data.
4. DO NOT invent processes or best practices not mentioned in tickets.
5. Keep the article SHORT and FOCUSED - aim for 50% less content than you might typically write.
6. Write in a direct style addressing ticket creators.

# Focus on
1. Common issues seen in these tickets (briefly).
2. Actual solutions that worked (from ticket resolutions).
3. Minimal, specific advice based only on ticket content.

# Output Format
Your response should be a concise markdown document with:
1.  Title: A brief descriptive title
2.  Common Issues: 2-3 bullet points of the main issues (be brief)
3. Tips for Resolution: Specific advice based ONLY on what worked in the tickets
4.  Resources: Only mention systems/links that appear in the tickets

Total length should be no more than 400-500 words maximum.

export const getCategoryMergePrompt = (categorySetsJson: string): string => `
You are analyzing multiple sets of knowledge categories from a supply chain management system. Your task is to merge these category sets into one comprehensive, non-redundant taxonomy.

# Category Sets
\`\`\`
${categorySetsJson}
\`\`\`

# Task
Merge these category sets into a single comprehensive taxonomy. Each category set was derived from different batches of ticket data, so they may contain:
1.  Identical categories that appear in multiple sets
2.  Similar categories with slight variations in name, description, or identifying patterns
3.  Unique categories that only appear in one set

For the merged taxonomy:
1.  Consolidate identical or highly similar categories
2. For similar categories, combine the best elements of each description and merge identifying patterns
3.  Preserve unique categories that represent distinct knowledge areas
4. Keep descriptions brief (50 words maximum)
5.  Limit to maximum 15 identifying patterns per category

# Important Guidelines
1.  Focus on semantic similarity, not just text matching
2. When merging similar categories, choose the clearest name and most comprehensive description
3.  Combine identifying patterns from similar categories but avoid redundancy
4.  Ensure the final taxonomy is comprehensive with minimal redundancy
5. Be extremely concise with category names and descriptions

# Output Format
Return a JSON structure with the merged categories:
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Short Category Name",
      "description": "Brief description",
      "identifying_patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2", "pattern3"]
    }
  ],
  "merge_summary": "Brief description of how the merging was done"

Ensure your JSON is properly formatted and valid. Be extremely concise with all text to minimize token usage.

# Task
Create a taxonomy of SUBCATEGORIES for these tickets. These tickets all belong to the same main category, but need to be further organized into more specific subcategories.

For each subcategory:
1.  Provide a clear, concise name to capture the specific issue type (5 words or less)
2.  Write a brief description of what this subcategory encompasses (50 words or less)
3. List identifying patterns or keywords (maximum 10 per subcategory)

# Important Guidelines
1.  Focus ONLY on subcategories that are ACTUALLY REPRESENTED in the sample tickets
2. The subcategories should be distinct from each other with minimal overlap
3. The number of subcategories should reflect the diversity in the sample - DO NOT create more subcategories than justified by the samples
4. The subcategory names should clearly relate to the parent category but be more specific
5. Be extremely concise with subcategory names and descriptions
6. DO NOT use your general knowledge to invent subcategories - rely ONLY on what's in the data
